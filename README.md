This is the first project of my Weekly projects challenge where I make and finish a new project each week, every project is designed to teach me and make me better at a specific aspect of programming whilst making it fun for me. 

This is Week 1 and the project is a copy of the mobile game Pickcrafter but for PC.

It will be similar but more bare bones and it will be just to teach me about 2D OpenGL usage.
